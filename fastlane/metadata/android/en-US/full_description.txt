Dicio can receive input through a text box or through <a href="https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/">Vosk</a> <i>speech to text</i>, and can talk using toasts or the Android <i>speech synthesis</i> engine. <b>Interactive graphical output</b> is provided by skills when they answer a question.

Each skill can be enabled, disabled or customized using the related settings screen. Dark, black and dynamic color themes are available.

The user input is interpreted by specific, yet reusable, libraries: <a href="https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler">dicio-sentences-compiler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-numbers">dicio-numbers</a>.

This app has the <i>NonFreeNet</i> anti-feature because some skills use non-free services to obtain the information requested by the user. You can easily disable unwanted skills or choose alternative services via settings.
