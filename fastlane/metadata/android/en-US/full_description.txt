Each skill can be enabled, disabled or customized using the related settings screen. A dark theme is available.

The user input is interpreted by specific, yet reusable, libraries: <a href="https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler">dicio-sentences-compiler</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-skill">dicio-skill</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-numbers">dicio-numbers</a>.

This app has the <i>NonFreeNet</i> anti-feature because some skills use non-free services to obtain the information requested by the user. You can easily disable unwanted skills or choose alternative services via settings.
