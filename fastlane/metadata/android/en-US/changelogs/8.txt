Join the discussion for a new logo: https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android/issues/74

New:
- The Vosk Speech To Text service can now take dictation, including in other apps, e.g. when pressing the microphone button
- Add current time skill
- Add French and Russian translations for telephone skill
  - and for timer, too, though `dicio-numbers` doesn't support those languages yet

Fixed:
- [Vosk] Fix crash when downloading the model on old Android versions, due to missing storage permission
