Dicio now has an IRC/Matrix channel: #dicio:libera.chat

Improved:
- [Vosk] Now multiple possible interpretations are provided for what the user said, and the app uses the first one it can understand
- [Telephone] Translate the skill into Spanish
- Add an error reporting activity, similar to NewPipe's, so that (skill) errors can be reported

Fixed:
- Fix input editing view remaining focused after input is sent
- [Timer] Fix Timer not hidden for languages not supported by dicio-numbers
